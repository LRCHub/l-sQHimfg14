You know it when you wake up
Put on your shirt and go out
You should know the way by heart
Now we hardly even know it when its gold
The dew lays stricken
You can even guard yourself to breath
It calls you in the morning
And you wanted nothing but change before the world

But hard days came over me
I'm a teenager, I'm anxious and alone
Hard days came over me

Is someone ever going to look down
You wouldn't even try now would you
We used to be the fighters here
We didn't want it anymore
??
We didn't want to try to support it

But hard days came over me
I'm a teenager, I'm anxious and alone
Hard days came over me
