One, two, three
Going down to see you
One, two, three
I promised i'll be very soon
One, two, three
I've got these things to bring to you
One, two, three
You won't be there why should i care for you?

The time it takes for me to tell you
But i think it's too much time for you to wait around for me
You wanna hear me say the words
You wanna hear when i want to say those words you can't be found
You're never around

One, two, three
You've got this thing about acting tough
Not like me, i'm always one step back
But when i finally catch up you're telling me it's too late it's the end of the endings

One, two, three
I'm going down to see you
One, two, three
Promised i'll be very soon
One, two, three
I've got these things to bring to you
One, two, three
You won't be there why should i care for you?

One, two, three
I'm going down to see
One, two, three
Coming down to see you
One, two, three
I'm going down to see
One, two, three
It brings me down to see you
