Baby, please stop messin' round
You're messin' round all the time
Yeah baby, please don't messin' round
You're messin' round all the time
Now, if you don't stop messin' round
You'll be somebody's baby 'stead of mine, yeah

Squeeze me, baby
My face turns cherry red
You roll me so hard, baby, I'm fallin' out of bed
Now please stop messin' round
Yes, you're messin' round all the time
Now, if you don't stop messin' round
You'll be somebody's baby instead of mine
