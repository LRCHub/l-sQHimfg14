Summer's come and now you're gone
You went to where it's hotter
I left Olympia too
I went north for the water
Swimming every day
I wanted you to be here for that
So I'll come and pick you up
We'll go swimming on the way

Now you're still where it's hotter
It's true, I left north for water
Eighteen more days
I can't wait to see you

Now two months have passed
I picked you up from home at last
Up north the water's getting colder
But now I keep thinking about Florida
It was hot, we stayed in the water
I wanted to keep this thought forever
In my head we're still in the water
